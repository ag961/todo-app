## To Do List Manager

A Web Application for securely managing a To Do List

## Phase 3: Adding security and access controls to the application.

In this final phase, we’ll be requiring that users be logged in, in order to see the to do items. Additionally, based on their user type, they will be allowed (or denied) to perform actions such as editing or deleting them.
